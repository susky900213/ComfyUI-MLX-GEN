"""Declared capability contract for the restoration families behind ``mlxgen upscale``.

Two families share that command - SeedVR2, which restores images and video and can
upscale, and SwiftVR, which restores video in one step at the source resolution. Before
this module the only way to ask "can this restoration model do images?" was to match on a
family string, and the refusals a family owed the user were nine hardcoded
``parser.error`` calls in one CLI. This module makes both of those things data.

WHY A RECORD AND NOT A PROTOCOL OR AN ABC
-----------------------------------------
The video half of the interface already exists and needs declaring, not inventing:
``SeedVR2.restore_video_to_path`` and ``SwiftVR.restore_video_to_path`` share a name and
an identical keyword-only core (``video_path``, ``resolution``, ``output_path``,
``start_seconds``, ``max_frames``, ``color_correction_mode``, ``drop_audio``,
``export_json_metadata``, ``overwrite``, ``validate_health``, ``restore_metadata``,
``enforce_memory_budget``) with identical defaults, both returning ``Path``. They differ
only in family extras.

The image half cannot be a total interface. SeedVR2 pairs the repo-wide in-memory house
name ``generate_image() -> GeneratedImage`` with ``restore_image_to_path``, the
write-to-disk route this record declares because it mirrors ``restore_video_to_path``;
SwiftVR has neither and must not carry a stub that raises. A ``Protocol`` or ABC covering both would therefore be non-total, and there is no
generic consumer to justify one: ``_run_swiftvr_restore`` holds a ``SwiftVR``,
``_run_video_with_fresh_model`` holds a ``SeedVR2``, and ``upscale_main()`` dispatches to
two genuinely different ``main()`` flows. A Protocol here would be documentation with no
call site.

So the route name is a *field* (:attr:`RestoreCapability.route_method`), exactly the way
``task_inference.GenerationCapability.handler_id`` names a handler with a string. The
static guarantee an ABC would give is replaced by a weight-free test asserting
``hasattr(route_class, capability.route_method)`` for every declared row - which checks
the real classes rather than a declaration.

WHAT THIS MODULE DESCRIBES AND WHAT IT DOES NOT ENFORCE
-------------------------------------------------------
:attr:`RestoreCapability.scale_mode` is descriptive. The authoritative 1x rule lives in
``SwiftVRUtil.output_canvas``, which has the source dimensions and already raises the
message naming ``--resolution 1x`` and ``--model seedvr2-3b``. A second copy here would be
a rule with two sources that can disagree. The record describes; ``output_canvas``
enforces; there is one enforcement site.

The same split holds for the route-level guards. ``SwiftVR._assert_supported_options``,
``_assert_quantization_supported`` and ``_assert_clip_length_supported`` are NOT replaced
by :attr:`RestoreFamilyCapabilities.unsupported_options`. The route is a public Python API
callable without argparse and must fail closed on its own; the record is what the CLI
refuses from. Two layers is intentional.
