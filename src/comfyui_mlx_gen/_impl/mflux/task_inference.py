# couples the whole canvas - so the paste is what returns the original pixels, and it is safe

    A separate row type from :class:`GenerationCapability` on purpose. That dataclass

    reframe, LoRA profiles, SVI anchors, canvas policies) which are all meaningless for a
    promptless restorer, and ``resolve_generation_plan`` filters over that exact type.
    Only the two proven cardinality predicates are mirrored, byte-for-byte in semantics,
    so consumer code that already gates on them keeps working.

    Every field here earns its place by one of two rules: some route or CLI currently
    raises on the corresponding option, or the value is a hard numeric limit a caller
    cannot discover without a failed preflight.
